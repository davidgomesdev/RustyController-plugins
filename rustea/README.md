### How to configure

Create a `teas.json` file with a Json as such:

```json
{
  "duration": "60", # this is in seconds, hint: https://www.inchcalculator.com/convert/minute-to-second/
  "pool": [
    {
      "name": "white",
      "hue": 0,
      "saturation": 1.0,
      "value": 0.5
    }
  ]
}
```
