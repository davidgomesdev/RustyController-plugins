## RustyController plugins

Little scripts that use the [RustyController](https://github.com/LegendL3n/RustyController) API to create amazing effects.

### Rustea

Has a list of colors, each corresponding to a tea, and chooses a random one, allowing me to decide which one to take in the morning :9.

### Weathery

Queries [IPMA](https://www.ipma.pt/opencms/pt/index.html) for the next day's weather, and sets the color accordingly.

### Brewertender

Counts down the time of a tea.

#### How to use

Press the `Move` button twice, then one of the 4 main buttons to select the tea.

It then will "brew" the tea, and at the end rumble to notify it has been brewed.

Press the `Move` button again to stop it. 

In any step you can press the `Move` button to cancel the process.
